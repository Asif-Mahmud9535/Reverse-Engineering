	<h1>Understanding Binary Files</h1>
	<p>Binary files are computer files that contain binary data - that is, information stored in the form of zeros and ones. They are used extensively in reverse engineering to analyze and understand how software works.</p>
	<p>In contrast to text files that contain human-readable characters, binary files can only be read by computers because their contents are encoded using binary digits. Some examples of common binary files include executable files (.exe), image files (.jpg, .png), and audio files (.mp3).</p>
	<p>Reverse engineers use binary files to gain insight into how a program operates, how it communicates with other software and hardware components, and how it stores and processes data. This is often done by disassembling the binary file into assembly language code, which can then be analyzed and optimized.</p>
	<p>Binary files also have many other uses beyond reverse engineering. They are used for storing data in a compact form, transmitting information across networks, and performing low-level system operations. Since binary data is more compact than text data, it can often be transmitted more quickly and efficiently over networks.</p>

	<h2>Sample Binary Code</h2>
	<p>Below is an example of binary code:</p>
	<code>
		01000110 01101111 01101111 01100010 01100001 01110010
	</code>
	<p>This is the binary representation of the ASCII characters "Foobar". Each character is represented by a sequence of eight bits (zeros and ones). By breaking down binary files in this way, reverse engineers can gain a deeper understanding of how software operates at a very low level.</p>
